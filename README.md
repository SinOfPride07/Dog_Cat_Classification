# DOG CAT CLASSIFIER
A Simple CNN Image Classifier Model

This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Network to classfiy images from the famous Dog Cat Dataset.

To reproduce the results:
1. Clone the repo
2. Download the model from the Google Drive link and move it to the Dog_Cat_Classification folder
3. Run Anaconda Command Prompt and change the directory to the Dog_Cat_Classification folder
4. Run app.py on the command prompt using "python app.py"
5. Use the Flask app to use the Web App
